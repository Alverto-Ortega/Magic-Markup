# Magic-Markup
My first Google Chrome Extension


Inside the Magic Markup folder: \
The Images folder contains my icon images used for my extension system UI.\
The popup files involve my system User Interface\
The Manifest files handles permissions, etc.\
The background file is my background script which handles the screenshot event.\
The canvasDrawing file is my content script that interacts with the DOM.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜Ž
